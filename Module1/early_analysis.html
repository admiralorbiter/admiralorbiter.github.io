        <h2>1800s: The Age of Basic Tools</h2>
        <h3>Hand-Drawn Graphs</h3>
        <p>
          Long before the invention of electronic spreadsheets, people relied on
          hand-drawn graphs to visualize data to provide perspective on hisotrical events. William Playfair, a Scottish
          engineer and political economist, is credited with inventing various
          types of graphs like the line graph, bar chart, and pie chart in the
          late 18th century.

        <h3>The Birth of Averages</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of the "average" became a popular tool for summarizing
          data. Simple measures like mean, median, and mode were the go-to
          metrics for understanding large datasets. These were especially useful
          in fields like astronomy, where data points were collected manually
          through telescopic observations.
        </p>

        <h3>Census Taking</h3>
        <p>
          Governments started to realize the importance of data for governance
          and began conducting censuses. The data collected was usually
          tabulated manually and used to make informed decisions about resource
          allocation.

        <h3>Probability Theory</h3>
        <p>
          The 19th century also saw significant developments in probability
          theory, spurred in part by interests in games of chance. This laid the
          groundwork for more complex statistical analysis in the future.

            <h3>Statistical Sampling</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            With the rise of mass production and increased complexity in social
            systems, it became impractical to collect data from every individual
            item or person. Statistical sampling techniques, like random
            sampling, became vital for making generalizations about larger
            populations.

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            The early to mid-20th century saw the development of hypothesis
            testing as a standard method for drawing conclusions from data. The
            t-test, Chi-square test, and ANOVA became common statistical methods
            used in research across various fields.

            <h3>Multivariate Analysis</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            As datasets became more complex, statistical theories expanded to
            accommodate multiple variables. Techniques like regression analysis,
            factor analysis, and principal component analysis became essential
            tools in the statistician's toolbox.

            <h3>Birth of Computational Statistics</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            Though not yet in the age of personal computers, the latter half of
            the 20th century witnessed the use of mainframe computers for more
            complicated statistical calculations. This era set the stage for the
            computational power that we take for granted today.
