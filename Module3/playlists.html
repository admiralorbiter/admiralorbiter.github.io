<h2>Tableau Best Practices</h2>

1. Review Process: Another Perspective
It's often said that two heads are better than one. When working with data, sometimes we might miss out on a detail or two. Hence, getting someone else to review our work can provide fresh insights or catch any potential mistakes. However, if you're racing against the clock, it might be tempting to skip this step. Remember, while time is crucial, the accuracy and clarity of our visuals are just as important.

Quick Tip: If you're short on time, at least take a brief break before reviewing your work. A short break can offer a fresh perspective.

2. Creation of Worksheets
As a data analyst, when creating worksheets:

Focus on clarity: Ensure that your visualizations are easy to understand at a glance.
Stay consistent: Use the same color schemes and formatting to maintain consistency.
Optimize for performance: Avoid using heavy calculations that can slow down your worksheet.
3. Designing an Effective Dashboard
To craft a dashboard that tells a compelling story:

Keep it simple: Avoid cluttering. Every element should have a purpose.
Organize logically: Place related charts and visuals close to each other.
Prioritize interactivity: Use filters, highlighters, and drill-downs to make your dashboard engaging.
4. Graph Variety: One Data, Many Views
Data can be like a chameleon â€“ it can take on many appearances. By visualizing data in different ways, such as bar graphs, line charts, or heat maps, we can discover the most effective way to convey its message. Experiment and compare!

5. Building a Dashboard: Golden Rules
When constructing a dashboard for a project:

Define its purpose: What do you want the viewer to take away from it?
Tailor it to your audience: Consider the level of detail and complexity they'd prefer.
Test and refine: Before finalizing, gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
6. Project Design: Starting with Purpose
Every solid building needs a foundation, and in the world of analytics, that foundation is a clear purpose. Ask yourself:

What do I want to achieve with this project?
Who is my target audience?
How will the results be used?
Thinking Point: One question that might NOT fit in designing your project could be: "What color scheme is the most popular this season?" While colors are essential for aesthetics, they should align with your data's story, not just current trends.
