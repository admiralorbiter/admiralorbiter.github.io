        <p class="mb-1">
          It's often said that two heads are better than one. When working with
          data, sometimes we might miss out on a detail or two. Hence, getting
          someone else to review our work can provide fresh insights or catch
          any potential mistakes. However, if you're racing against the clock,
          it might be tempting to skip this step, but this is the last thing you should cut.
        </p>

            Remember, while time is crucial, the accuracy and clarity of our
            visuals are just as important.</u

            Quick Tip: If you're short on time, at least take a brief break
            before reviewing your work. A short break can offer a fresh
            perspective.

        </div>

        <p class="mb-1">
          Keep it simple: Avoid cluttering. Every element should have a
          purpose.Organize logically: Place related charts and visuals close to
          each other. Prioritize interactivity: Use filters, highlighters, and
          drill-downs to make your dashboard engaging.

          Data can be like a chameleon â€“ it can take on many appearances. By
          visualizing data in different ways, such as bar graphs, line charts,
          or heat maps, we can discover the most effective way to convey its
          message. Experiment and compare that way you can see the most effective way to display the data.

        <p class="mb-1">
          Define its purpose: What do you want the viewer to take away from it?
          Tailor it to your audience: Consider the level of detail and
          complexity they'd prefer. Test and refine: Before finalizing, gather
          feedback and make necessary adjustments.

          <small class="text-body-secondary">
            Every solid building needs a foundation, and in the world of
            analytics, that foundation is a clear purpose. Ask yourself:
          </small>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-1">
          What do I want to achieve with this project? Who is my target
          audience? How will the results be used? Thinking Point: One question
          that might NOT fit in designing your project could be: "What color
          scheme is the most popular this season?" While colors are essential
          for aesthetics, they should align with your data's story, not just
          current trends.
        </p>
        <b>Questions to Ask:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>What data might be missing?</li>
          <li>What data relationships might be important?</li>
          <li>Why should the data be analyzed?</li>
