          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Imagine you're looking at a picture of a beautiful garden. Most of the flowers are blue, but there's one bright red flower in the middle. That red flower stands out, right? In the world of data, this "stand-out" point is called an anomaly. When we look at numbers and data, these anomalies can tell us something interesting or hint that something might be wrong.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="my-4">
          <h2>Types of Anomalies</h2>
          <p>There are different ways something can stand out in a dataset:
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Point anomalies</strong>: Like finding a single red apple in a basket of green ones. It's just one odd data point.</li>
                  <li><strong>Contextual anomalies</strong>: Imagine you wear a heavy jacket in July. It's weird because July is usually hot, but wearing that jacket in December would be normal. So, the context matters!</li>
                  <li><strong>Collective anomalies</strong>: Think of a team where everyone is great individually, but they just can't win when they play together. Each player is fine by themselves, but as a group, something's off.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="my-4">
          <h2>Handling Anomalies</h2>
          <p>When we spot these stand-out points, we can't just ignore them. We need to figure out why they're there. Sometimes they're just a fluke, like a rare rainbow-colored butterfly. But other times, they might mean there's a problem, like a leaky faucet causing a water puddle. Deciding what to do depends on what we're looking at and why we think the anomaly happened.</p>
          <p>Ready for a challenge? Below is a chart showing how much a make-believe company sold each month. Can you spot any strange or unexpected sales numbers? What do you think might have caused them? Play detective and try to figure it out!</p>
